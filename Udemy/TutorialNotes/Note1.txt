Synchronous code is Blocking in nature as it don't allow next statement to 
executes until this code executes.

Asynchronous code is Non-Blocking in nature as it allow next statement to
executes even current code is still running. It accepts a callback function.

Callback Hell: its a case when one callback depends on another and another of another and so on.
                Here its like Synchronous requests and not any benefit for asynchronous.
Solution:: using promises or async/await.

For routing in app, we use express.
